<script src="main.bundle.js?v=1555491481682" type="text/javascript"></script>


<div class="container">

    <div class="markdown"><textarea readonly>

    # Where to use it

    Any place that accepts some scripts and some html tags


    # How to use it

    Embed the following basic structure

    ```
          <script src="main.bundle.js?v=1555491481682"></script>

          <div class="roadmap">

            Project A, Task 1
            2019-01-01, 10w
            Team 1

            Project A, Task 2 - another 10 weeks
            2019-01-01 + 10w, 10w
            Team 1, Team 2

          </div>

    ```

    The example above will render the following roadmap:
    </textarea></div>

    <div class="roadmap" style="width: 800px; font-size: 12px">
        Project A, Task 1
        2019-01-01, 10w
        Team 1

        Project A, Task 2 - another 10 weeks
        2019-01-01 + 10w, 10w
        Team 1, Team 2

    ## A task element

    A task element has a very simple format:

    - first line (mandatory): Project and Task Name, comma separated. Example: `Project A, Task 1`
    - second line (mandatory): A Date Interval. Examples:
        * `2019-01-01, 2019-01-15` - 15 days task, inclusive
        * `2019-01-01, 2w` - 2 week task
        * `2019-01-01 + 2w, 2w` - 2 week task, starting on 14th of Jan
        * `2019-01-03` - **no end date**, signals a milestone

    - third line (mandatory): Team List, comma separated. Example: `Team A, Team B`

    - following lines can contain markers that allow for extra configuration of the task item
        * `^`: links, multiple lines. Links show up in the roadmap item body and have the format `link-name | link-url`

        Example:

        ```
        Project A, Milestone A
        2019-01-10
        Team A
        ^ google | https://google.com
        ^ bing | https://bing.com
        ```


        * `@`: comma separated labels

        Example:

        ```
        Project A, Milestone A
        2019-01-10
        Team A
        @ important-milestone, planned
        ```

        * `>`: description lines, can have multiple on a single block and will show up as a description on the task tooltip

        Example:

        ```
        Project A, Milestone A
        2019-01-10
        Team A
        > A critical milestone
        > More important than Milestone B
        ```


    Putting it all together, here is a full task item definition (note the styling for the unplanned label):


        <div class="roadmap" data-view="project">
            Project A, Milestone A
            2019-01-10 + 9w
            Team A
            @ important-milestone, planned
            ^ google | https://google.com
            > A critical milestone
            > More important than Milestone B

            Project A, Task A
            2019-01-10 + 5w, 5w
            Team A
            ^ bing | https://bing.com
            @unplanned

            Project A, Task B
            2019-01-10 + 6w, 2w

            Project B, Task B
            2019-01-20 + 2w, 3w

# Using the timeline

Once the timeline is rendered, you can interact with it:

- click on it to activate it
- ctrl + pinch zoom - zoom the timeline
- click and drag to move left to right
- hover over tasks or milestones to visualise the description, detailed time information
- click on tasks or milestones to set a custom time-bar

You also have a useful edit mode. Click on the "Edit" button above the timeline and it will show
you the list of items that the timeline was rendered from. Edit stuff and refresh.

Obviously, if you want to save edits, embed back the item in the roadmap div

# Configure the timeline rendering

The roadmap div supports optional data attributes that you can use to configure the rendering. Full example:


    <div class="roadmap"
         data-start="2019-06-01"
         data-end="2019-12-01"
         data-view="project,team,milestones">

        My Project, My Task
        2019-06-20 + 2w, 3w
        A Team

    </div>

# Development

This project is a playground for Kotlin JS + React .
All you will need to do is to open it in IDEA and you are good to go.

Run `./gradlew build -t` to start the compile process that continuously compiles kotlin2js.

Run `./gradlew webpackDevServer` to start the webpack server that refreshes the browser and provides error info.

Edit `src/main/resources/index.html` (this doc) to see changes in realtime.

# Building

Run `./gradlew docs` to update the documentation in the `docs` folder. Commit and push
